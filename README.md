# recycling-buddy


This bot helps users easily determine whether an item is recyclable or just trash by simply uploading or taking a picture. Additionally, if the item is recyclable, the bot will provide the 5 nearest recycling spots based on the user's location.

üì∏ How It Works
1. Upload or Take a Picture:
- Users can upload or take a picture of the item they want to check.
2. Get a Classification:
- The bot will analyze the image and categorize the item as either Recyclable or Trash.
3. Find Nearby Recycling Spots:
- If the item is recyclable, the bot will prompt the user to input their location.
- The bot will then provide the 5 nearest recycling spots where the item can be properly disposed of.

This bot was adapted from the trained model at this link [https://www.kaggle.com/code/bouweceunen/garbage-detection-with-tensorflow/notebook].
The locations of the recycling bins were adapted from gov.sg's api and cleaned up.
